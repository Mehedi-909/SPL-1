Classification:
There are three semantic paradigms for slicing: static, dynamic and conditioned and two
syntactic paradigms: syntax-preserving and amorphous.

There are two dimensions to slicing: a syntactic dimension and a semantic dimension. The semantic
dimension describes that which is to be preserved.

In the syntactic dimension there is comparatively less choice. There are two possibilities. Firstly, the
slice can preserve the program’s original syntax wherever possible, merely removing parts of the
program which can be found to have no effect on the semantics of interest. This is known as a syntaxobserving
slice. Secondly, the slice can be free to perform any syntactic transformation which
preserves the semantic constraints desired. This is known as amorphous slicing
